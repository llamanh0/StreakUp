## ⚠️ Risk Management and Alternative Plans

### Potential Challenges and Solutions

#### 1. Time Management Issues
```
Risk: Time shortage due to classes and other assignments
Solution: 
- Focus on minimum viable product (MVP)
- Save time for optional features later
- Even 1-2 hours daily can be sufficient
```

#### 2. Technical Difficulties
```
Risk: Difficulty learning Flutter/Firebase
Solution:
- Choose simpler technology (e.g., local storage)
- Get mentor/friend support
- Join online communities
```

#### 3. Scope Creep
```
Risk: Desire to add too many features
Solution:
- Stay loyal to MVP list
- Distinguish "Nice to have" vs "Must have"
- Keep feature list for version 2
```

### Alternative Technology Options

#### Plan A (Recommended): Flutter + Firebase
```
Advantages: Modern, scalable, abundant learning resources
Disadvantages: Learning curve exists
Duration: 10-12 weeks
```

#### Plan B (Simpler): Flutter + Local Storage
```
Advantages: Less dependencies, works offline
Disadvantages: Group features difficult, no sync
Duration: 8-10 weeks
```

#### Plan C (Simplest): Native Android + SQLite
```
Advantages: Fewer dependencies, works offline
Disadvantages: Group features difficult, Android only
Duration: 8-10 weeks
```
